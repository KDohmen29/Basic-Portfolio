            <p>I come from a small town in Minnesota, or what some people would call Minnesnowta! 
            I grew up in a country house, in the woods.  When I was younger, I was always interested in building things and 
            finding out how random things work, especially electronics.  I never really got into depth about learning how to code,
            but almost everyone I know tells me that they think I will be really good at it. I always had it in my mind that I would 
            eventually try to learn and see how I like it. Six years after moving out to California, I finally decided to take the leap
            and sign up for school!
